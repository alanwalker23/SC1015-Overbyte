## About
This is a mini-project for SC1015 (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Learning Analytics from the [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance). 
For detailed walkthrough please view in the following format:

## Problem Definition
Are we able to determine if a student will fail based on his lifestyle?
Can we predict which "band" a student will fall into based on previous records?
Following these bands we can remedy their scores and provide appropriate support.

## Models Used
Elbow Plot for Cluster Selection
KMeans & KPrototype clustering
Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrogram)
Decision Tree

## Conclusion
Parent's education place a part in one's school performance.  
Mother staying at home could be detrimental to one's school performance.  
Studying more equates to better grades, but given it is based on qualitative grounds, this might be reliant on one's confidence.  
Aiming for higher education does improve one's school performance (driven).  
Internet access plays a part in performance.  
Being absent for classes does not necessarily equate to bad performance, but there is a general trend of performing badly.  
Being self-aware and accepting of high alcohol consumption on weekly and daily basis would negatively affect performance.

## What did we learn from this project?
